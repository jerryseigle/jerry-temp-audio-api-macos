`react-native-audio-api` provides system for controlling audio in React Native environment compatible with Web Audio API specification,
allowing developers to generate and modify audio in exact same way it is possible in browsers.

## Roadmap

### Planned

### <img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Coming_in-x.x.x-orange" />

- **DynamicCompressorNode 〽️**<br />
  Reduce the volume of loud sounds and boost quieter nodes to balance the audio signal, avoid clipping or distorted sounds

- **Audio tag 🏷️**<br />
  Simple ability to play and buffer audio, with all of the most commonly used functions, same as on the web, without the need to create and manipulate an audio graph.

- **MIDI support 🎸**<br />
  Complementary lib for react-native-audio-api, that will allow to communicate with MIDI devices or read/write MIDI files.

- **Spatial Audio 🛢️**<br />
  manipulate audio in 3D space

- **Noise Cancellation 🦇**<br />
  System-based active noise and echo cancellation support

### <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-audio-api/releases/tag/0.11.0"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Released_in-0.11.0-green" /></a>

- **Recording to file 📼**<br />
  Fully customizable recording to a file. Choose a file format, quality and other parameters. Fully integrated with the audio graph.

- **Playback and recording notification system 🔔**<br />
  Control playback and recording from the notification center / lock screen and create custom notification layouts.

- **Wave Shaper Node 🎸**<br />
  Create custom nonlinear distortion effects. No need to buy guitar pedals anymore!

- **IIR Filter Node 🧪**<br />
  Implement custom digital filters using feedforward and feedback coefficients.

### <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-audio-api/releases/tag/0.10.0"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Released_in-0.10.0-green" /></a>

- **Decoding and utility modules 🔧**<br />
  Decode and modify audio data without the need to create AudioContext first through a set of utility classes

- **Convolver Node 🐐**<br />
  Realistic reverb and spatial effects in the browser by applying impulse responses. It makes audio sound like it’s being played in real spaces, from small rooms to cathedrals, or through hardware like amps and speakers

- **JS Audio Worklets V2 🐎**<br />
  Customize the process pipeline with JS functions running on audio thread.

### <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-audio-api/releases/tag/0.9.0"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Released_in-0.9.0-green" /></a>

- **JS Audio Worklets V1 🐎**<br />
  Receive events and data callbacks from audio thread to synchronize with UI on UI thread.

### <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-audio-api/releases/tag/0.8.0"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Released_in-0.8.0-green" /></a>

- **Decoding support for m4a/mp4/aac/ogg/opus 📁** <br />
  Decode m4a/mp4/aac/ogg/opus audio files, allowing for playback of these formats in the audio graph.

- **HLS streaming support** 🌊 <br />
  Stream audio from HLS sources, allowing for playback of live audio streams or pre-recorded audio files.

### <a href="https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-audio-api/releases/tag/0.7.0"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Released_in-0.7.0-green" /></a>

- **Microphone support 🎙️** <br />
  Grab audio data from device microphone or connected device, connect it to the audio graph or stream through the internet.

- **Custom Audio Processor ⚙️** <br />
  Write your own processing AudioNode.
